/**
 * Marker of a public Tyrus API that is still in "beta" non-final version.
 * <p>
 * This annotation signals that the annotated public Tyrus API (package, class, method or field)
 * has not been fully stabilized yet. As such, the API is subject to backward-incompatible changes
 * (or even removal) in a future Tyrus release. Tyrus development team does not make any guarantees
 * to retain backward compatibility of a {@code @Beta}-annotated Tyrus API.
 * <p>
 * This annotation does not indicate inferior quality or performance of the API, just informs that the
 * API may still evolve in the future in a backward-incompatible ways. Tyrus users may use beta APIs
 * in their applications keeping in mind potential cost of extra work associated with an upgrade
 * to a newer Tyrus version.
 * <p>
 * Once a {@code @Beta}-annotated Tyrus API reaches the desired maturity, the {@code @Beta} annotation
 * will be removed from such API and the API will become part of a stable public Tyrus API.
